> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress:** TraderDesk is actively evolving toward a live trading platform. The current release focuses on research and backtesting while the team builds out the broker connectivity, execution, and risk controls required for production use.

### üõ£Ô∏è Live Trading Roadmap Highlights
- ‚úÖ **Today:** Research workflow with historical market data, signal generation, performance analytics, and an AI predictor powering the live engine prototype.
- üöß **In Development:** Modular execution engine hardening, broker API integration, and real-time data ingestion.
- üóìÔ∏è **Planned:** Automated risk management, monitoring dashboards, compliance tooling, and multi-asset portfolio coordination for safe live deployment.

### üß≠ What You Can Do Right Now
- Fetch and clean market data
- Generate trading signals
- Backtest strategies with realistic assumptions
- Interpret performance metrics
- Experiment with the new AI predictor and paper-broker live trading engine scaffolding

## üß† Getting Started with AI-Assisted Live Trading

The `traderdesk.ai` module introduces a lightweight ridge-regression predictor that learns from historical closing prices and estimates the next-bar return with an associated confidence score. The live trading prototype wires this predictor into a modular engine that can be pointed at a real broker once credentials and compliance checks are ready.

```python
from traderdesk import (
    AIPredictor,
    LiveTradingConfig,
    LiveTradingEngine,
    PaperBroker,
    YahooMarketDataProvider,
)

config = LiveTradingConfig(ticker="SPY", max_trade_notional=1000)
predictor = AIPredictor()
data_provider = YahooMarketDataProvider()
broker = PaperBroker()

engine = LiveTradingEngine(config, predictor, data_provider, broker)
decision = engine.evaluate_and_execute()
print(decision)
```

When the AI signal meets the built-in thresholds, the engine allocates up to the specified
`max_trade_notional` based on a blend of expected return strength and confidence, so you receive a
ready-to-execute share count without tuning expert parameters.

### üñ•Ô∏è One-Click AI Trades in the UI

Inside the Qt application you only provide a ticker and an **Investment Budget ($)**. Pressing
**AI Evaluate & Trade** runs the same engine as above, logs the forecast, and (when conditions are
met) sends a paper-trade order sized automatically by the AI model. If the budget is too small to
buy at least one share, the app will prompt you to raise it or pick a lower-priced asset‚Äîno expert
settings required.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The live trading components currently target a paper broker and do not handle order routing, authentication, or regulatory checks. They are meant for experimentation while the production integrations are being built.
