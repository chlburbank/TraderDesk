# üß† TraderDesk

**TraderDesk** is a desktop trading research tool built in Python.
It lets you visualize and backtest simple trading strategies (like SMA crossovers) using **free market data** from Yahoo Finance today, and it is being expanded into an **AI-assisted live-trading workstation**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress:** TraderDesk is actively evolving toward a live trading platform. The current release focuses on research and backtesting while the team builds out the broker connectivity, execution, and risk controls required for production use.

### üõ£Ô∏è Live Trading Roadmap Highlights
- ‚úÖ **Today:** Research workflow with historical market data, signal generation, performance analytics, and an AI predictor powering the live engine prototype.
- üöß **In Development:** Modular execution engine hardening, broker API integration, and real-time data ingestion.
- üóìÔ∏è **Planned:** Automated risk management, monitoring dashboards, compliance tooling, and multi-asset portfolio coordination for safe live deployment.

### üß≠ What You Can Do Right Now
- Fetch and clean market data
- Generate trading signals
- Backtest strategies with realistic assumptions
- Interpret performance metrics
- Experiment with the new AI predictor and paper-broker live trading engine scaffolding

## üß† Getting Started with AI-Assisted Live Trading

The `traderdesk.ai` module introduces a lightweight ridge-regression predictor that learns from historical closing prices and estimates the next-bar return with an associated confidence score. The live trading prototype wires this predictor into a modular engine that can be pointed at a real broker once credentials and compliance checks are ready.

```python
from traderdesk import (
    AIPredictor,
    LiveTradingConfig,
    LiveTradingEngine,
    PaperBroker,
    YahooMarketDataProvider,
)

config = LiveTradingConfig(ticker="SPY", max_trade_notional=1000)
predictor = AIPredictor()
data_provider = YahooMarketDataProvider()
broker = PaperBroker()

engine = LiveTradingEngine(config, predictor, data_provider, broker)
decision = engine.evaluate_and_execute()
print(decision)
```

When the AI signal meets the built-in thresholds, the engine allocates up to the specified
`max_trade_notional` based on a blend of expected return strength and confidence, so you receive a
ready-to-execute share count without tuning expert parameters.

### üîÑ Running the live engine continuously

Use the new runtime helpers to assemble the engine from environment-aware settings and drive it on
an automated schedule. This lets you point the app at the Polygon feed (or keep the Yahoo fallback)
and ensure the engine only evaluates during the hours you configure.

```python
from traderdesk import (
    LiveTradingRuntimeConfig,
    LiveTradingService,
    build_live_engine,
)

runtime = LiveTradingRuntimeConfig.from_env(
    ticker="SPY",
    max_trade_notional=1500,
)
engine = build_live_engine(runtime)
service = LiveTradingService(
    engine,
    interval=runtime.evaluation_interval,
    allow_outside_market_hours=runtime.run_outside_market_hours,
    market_open=runtime.market_open,
    market_close=runtime.market_close,
)

try:
    service.start()
    # keep the process alive, e.g. with a while True: time.sleep(...) loop
finally:
    service.stop()
```

Key environment variables you can set ahead of `LiveTradingRuntimeConfig.from_env` include:

- `TRADERDESK_PROVIDER` ‚Äì choose `yahoo` (default) or `polygon`.
- `TRADERDESK_LOOKBACK` / `TRADERDESK_INTERVAL` ‚Äì control model context and evaluation cadence.
- `TRADERDESK_MIN_CONFIDENCE`, `TRADERDESK_THRESHOLD`, `TRADERDESK_MAX_NOTIONAL` ‚Äì tune risk gates.
- `TRADERDESK_MARKET_OPEN` / `TRADERDESK_MARKET_CLOSE` ‚Äì limit evaluations to certain hours.
- `POLYGON_API_KEY`, `TRADERDESK_POLYGON_TIMESPAN`, `TRADERDESK_POLYGON_MULTIPLIER` ‚Äì configure the
  Polygon provider.

The Qt UI automatically reads these settings when it boots up, so the "AI Evaluate & Trade" button
uses the same live market data provider you configure for background services.

### üñ•Ô∏è One-Click AI Trades in the UI

Inside the Qt application you only provide a ticker and an **Investment Budget ($)**. Pressing
**AI Evaluate & Trade** runs the same engine as above, logs the forecast, and (when conditions are
met) sends a paper-trade order sized automatically by the AI model. If the budget is too small to
buy at least one share, the app will prompt you to raise it or pick a lower-priced asset‚Äîno expert
settings required.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The live trading components currently target a paper broker and do not handle order routing, authentication, or regulatory checks. They are meant for experimentation while the production integrations are being built.
